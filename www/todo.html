<p>Things to fix:</p>
<ul>
  <li>During Mixing, DV03 is currently in the wrong direction.  The
  problem is that liquid can pass through the membrane and out the
  permeate line.  The solution is to close off DV03 during Mixing.  It
  seems that the position of DV02 might also need to be considered in
  the same way.  It seems that this depends on the last direction
  change.</li>

  <li>The pause command does not pause the filling of product.</li>

  <li>The direction change timers do not reset to zero.</li>
</ul>
