<h2>Things to fix with PLC code:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>During Mixing, DV03 is currently in the wrong direction.  The
  problem is that liquid can pass through the membrane and out the
  permeate line.  The solution is to close off DV03 during Mixing.  It
  seems that the position of DV02 might also need to be considered in
  the same way.  It seems that this depends on the last direction
  change.</li>

  <li>The pause command does not pause the filling of product.</li>

  <li>The direction change timers do not reset to zero.  Should they?
  Is it better that we do not and rather keep a consistent duration
  between direction changes?</li>

  <li>There is currently no provision for the user to fill the tank on
  their own.  What would happen if we set fillSource to none and
  started production?</li>

  <li>When a fault occurs, the PIDs might be frozen, but the timers
  don't seem to be.  It moved states while faulting after ~30
  seconds.</li>

  <li>When the process is aborted, the concentration ratio reverts to
  one.  This isn't necessary.  Fix it.</li>

  <li>The PID controller for PC03 jumps out of manual setpoint all on
  its own.  Fix this.</li>

  <li>If dosing is longer than mixing+recirc, then dosing is cut
  short.</li>

  <li>Change dosing to be measured as a percentage of full tank.
  Dosing pump gives an average 3.82mL/s at 90% on pump's dial.</li>

</ul>
