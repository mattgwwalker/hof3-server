There are two parts to this repository, the website code and the server.

The website code can be found in the www_src directory.  The files
compile to the directory www, using the command "make".  This command
uses symbolic linking and thus requires a filesystem that supports it
(The default MacOS filesystem appears not to support relative symbolic
links.)
